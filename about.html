        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>Hi there I'm Myles Im 23 and am currently studying Computing at Buckinghamshire New University, I have always been fascinated with computers<br> 
            and always had a passion for knowing more about them. At the age of 16 I built my own computer and got it functioning by myself, although it<br> 
            wasn't the best setup and parts I felt very satisfied with myself and set out to do more. I then attended College where I did computer studies<br> 
            and later attended a different University but was dissatisfied with that Uni and thus moved to Bucks and now I have been tasked with creating a <br>
            website for one of my projects.
            <br>
            <br>The website is based around a Game I wish to create in the next few years. I have been making the game for the past year on and
            off, but after University is over I hope to make it a reality.
